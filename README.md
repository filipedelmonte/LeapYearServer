LeapYearServer
==============

Web server built in PHP using Silex micro-framework that computes whether a given year is leap or not.
I decided to use Silex instead of a full-stack frameworks due to the simplicity of the problem to be solved. 
Silex is a micro-framework based on Symfony2 components that provides a nice code architecture, flexibility and a wide API.
